# TengagedBlade


My first complete non static website, Tengagedblade is mostly meant as a practice project. 
Regardless, it provides popular functionality to the users of the website. 

Tengaged blade is hosted on a google vritual machine. It grabs a username which must be an existing user on Tengaged.com, 
scrapes the site and returns multiple relevant statistical figures. The scarping is done via Python and executed by a
CGI (common Gateway Interface) through apache. At this time, a database is not being maintained. Finally, Javascript and Ajax are used to load the website dynamically and run the scraping processes asychronously.
