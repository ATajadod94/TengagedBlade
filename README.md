# TengagedBlade


My first complete non static website, Tengagedblade is mostly meant as a practice project. 
Regardless, it provides popular functionality to the users of the website. 

Tengaged blade is hosted on a google vritual machine. It grabs a username which must be an existing user on Tengaged.com, 
scrapes the site and returns multiple relevant statistical figures. The scarping is done via Python and executed via a
common Gateway Interface. At this time, a database is not being collected. Finally, Ajax is used to load the
website dynamically.
